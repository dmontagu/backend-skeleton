# Backend API Skeleton

Based on @tiangolo's full stack postgres template, with some things added, some things removed, and some things changed.

This is a work in progress!

TODO:
-----

* Remove `fastapi_util` from the app repo, and make it a separate package
* Add example pydantic models, sqlalchemy models, endpoints
* Add `encode/databases` support (possibly in a separate template?)
